感谢贡献。请按下列模板填写。
PR 标题必须遵循 Conventional Commits（CI 强制校验），详见 CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md §9。
其余规则见 CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md。
-->

## 1. Repo URL · 仓库链接

<!-- Canonical primary URL of the entry (org/repo, not a fork). -->



## 2. Pillar + sub-category · 支柱 + 子类

<!--
Pick from existing sub-categories in README.md. Use the section label exactly as it
appears in the README sub-section heading.
Example: `Agents → Multi-agent decision frameworks`
-->



## 3. Entry bullet · 条目

<!--
Match the existing entry rendering. Example:

- [example/repo](https://github.com/example/repo) - One-sentence description in English under 120 chars. *(→ pairs with another-repo.)*

中文版同步，描述 ≤80 字。Do not include inline activity dates,
per-entry star counts, or bracketed curation badges. Put dates and
stars in the quality-bar metadata instead.
-->

```markdown

```

## 4. Quality-bar self-checklist · 质量门槛自评

<!-- Tick each box that applies. See CONTRIBUTING.md §2 / CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md §2 for full criteria. -->

- **GitHub stars at submission time**: <!-- e.g. 1.2k; repo entries normally need >=100 stars for the main list -->

- [ ] **Open source** — or has a public technical artifact
      (paper, architecture doc, reproducible demo).
- [ ] **Demonstrably LLM-driven** — LLM reasoning is a primary
      decision component (not feature extractor / post-hoc explainer).
- [ ] **Active in last 12 months** — or canonical / foundational reference.
- [ ] **Clear scope + minimal documentation**.
- [ ] **Distinct contribution** — not duplicative of existing entries.
- [ ] **Public credibility signal** — normally >=100 GitHub stars
      for repo entries, or a documented maintainer-level exception.

If any box is unchecked, briefly justify the waiver:

<!-- Justification (1–2 sentences) if not all boxes ticked. -->



## 5. Bilingual symmetric-edit · 双语对称编辑

<!--
Per CONTRIBUTING.md §6 / CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md §6, each PR that edits one
README MUST edit the other in the same PR, OR open a tracked
translation issue with a 7-day SLA. Tick exactly one:
-->

- [ ] I edited **both** `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` in this PR.
- [ ] I opened a tracked translation issue with 7-day SLA.
      Link: <!-- paste the issue URL here -->

## 6. Awesome-lint advisory check · awesome-lint 辅助检查

<!--
Optional but useful for README changes:
`npx --yes awesome-lint README.md`
`npx --yes awesome-lint README.zh-CN.md`

This is an advisory compatibility check, not a hard merge gate. Existing
local patterns such as stable anchors, compact pairing metadata, and cross-pillar
back-links may produce acceptable false positives.
-->

- [ ] I ran `npx --yes awesome-lint README.md`, or this PR does not change README structure.
- [ ] I ran `npx --yes awesome-lint README.zh-CN.md`, or this PR does not change README.zh-CN.md structure.
- Notes / ignored findings:



## 7. Curation notes (optional) · 策展说明（可选）

<!--
Optional: explain if the project is official, why it is distinct from
nearby entries, or whether it has a cross-pillar relationship that
should be mentioned in prose.
-->
